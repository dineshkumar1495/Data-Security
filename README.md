# Data-Security

This project evaluates the security practices of eSecurityFin, a financial services firm handling sensitive personal and financial data. 
With recent incidents such as data breaches, phishing attacks, and insider threats, the assessment identifies key vulnerabilities and 
weaknesses in the firm's cybersecurity framework.

Through a detailed risk analysis, the project examines areas like weak credentials, outdated encryption, lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA), 
and inadequate employee training. Using industry best practices, the assessment applies security principles based on the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, 
Integrity, and Availability) to propose targeted improvements.

Key recommendations include strengthening authentication mechanisms, implementing advanced encryption protocols (AES-GCM, RSA), enforcing strict access controls, 
and enhancing monitoring systems to mitigate risks effectively. The project aims to enhance eSecurityFinâ€™s cybersecurity posture by providing a strategic roadmap 
for securing sensitive data and preventing future cyber threats.
